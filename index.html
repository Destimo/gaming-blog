                <p> 
                    My name is Destiny and I am 23 years old.
                    I write about a variety of gaming-related subjects, with my posts taking the form of reviews, countdowns or longer articles.<br><br>
                    I've been a console gamer since I was a young child - my console experience ranges from the original PlayStation to Xbox 360 to the Nintendo Switch.
                    Gaming is truly one of my passions.
                    I have also been a PC gamer since November of 2023, and write a series based on my experiences with switching to this platform. <br><br>
                    I'm into a variety of franchises, including: <b>Spyro, The Legend of Zelda, Sonic the Hedgehog, Hades, Doom and The Elder Scrolls.</b>
                    I also love finding indie gems. My favourites this year have been Frogun, Duck Detective: The Secret Salami, Palworld and Bugsnax.
                    I would include the game I'm currently playing, but I tend to juggle a lot of games at once - I'm a very sporadic gamer!

                <h1>Gaming History</h1>
                <p> Growing up, I was exposed to a lot of games consoles.
                    This is largely due to the fact I have an older sister, meaning she had consoles that she handed down to me.
                    Not only this, but I took an interest myself and bought current consoles.
                    This means that I have a unique blend of gaming experience; I grew up with the same consoles as you'd expect from Gen Z - Xbox 360 etc., but I also could go and pick up my sister's GameBoy Advance. 
                    Because of this, I have an appreciation for the older games and consoles, while also staying up-to-date on current releases.
                    Indeed, growing up with 'older' games (games that are before my generation) meant that I became curious about trying the classics.<br><br>
                    This is something that has stayed with me and I feel it has helped to keep my expectations reasonable when it comes to gaming. 
                    I am able to look at these games - which can sometimes be quite barebones - and see their appeal. 
                    I've also experienced a variety of consoles and would say I have a strong understanding of their capabilities and limitations, and how these affect their games. <br><br>
                    I've owned/leeched many gaming platforms over the years. Some I still have, and others are just a memory. Here's a list of gaming platforms I have experience in:
